# Phishing Email Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based system to detect phishing emails. It uses various features extracted from email content to classify whether an email is legitimate or potentially malicious. This project was developed as part of a class assignment to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning in cybersecurity.

## Features

- Email preprocessing and feature extraction
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Real-time phishing email detection
- Web interface for easy interaction
- Model persistence for future use

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd phishing-email-detection
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model with your dataset:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

### Making Predictions

To predict whether an email is phishing or not:

```bash
python src/predict.py --email "path_to_email.txt"
```

### Running the Web Interface

To start the web application:

```bash
python requirements/app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Dependencies

- Flask: Web framework for the application interface
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- numpy: Numerical computing

## Model Details

The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze various features of emails, including:

- Email header information
- Content analysis
- URL patterns
- Attachment characteristics
- Sender information
